            <h1>Life on Earth</h1>
            <p>Although the exact process by which life formed on Earth is not well understood, the origin of life requires the presence of carbon-based molecules, liquid water, and an energy source. Because some Near-Earth Objects contain carbon-based molecules and water ice, collisions of these objects with Earth have been significant agents of biologic as well as geologic change.</p>

            <h1>Early Earth Formation</h1>
            <p>For the first billion years of Earth’s existence, the formation of life was prevented by comet and asteroid impacts, which made Earth's surface too hot for water and carbon-based molecules to exist. Life on Earth began at the end of this period, called the late heavy bombardment, around 3.8 billion years ago. The earliest fossils date back 3.5 billion years, with evidence of biological activity even earlier. The building blocks of life, water and carbon-based molecules, may have been delivered by comet and asteroid collisions.</p>

            <p>As impacts subsided, these collisions likely deposited essential materials that enabled life to form. Comets may have brought both life’s building blocks and caused extinction events, such as the Yucatan impact 65 million years ago, which wiped out the dinosaurs and allowed mammals, including humans, to flourish.</p>
