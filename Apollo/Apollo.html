            <h1>Discovery</h1>
            <p>The group is named after 1862 Apollo, which was discovered in 1932 by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth. It was lost shortly after, but rediscovered in 1978.</p>

            <h1>characteristics</h1>
            <p>Apollo asteroids have orbits that are larger than Earth's semi-major axis, but their perihelion distances are less than Earth's aphelion distance. They are smaller than 10 kilometers in size, and have relatively short lifetimes of about 10 million years. </p>
            
            <h1>Origin</h1>
            <p>Most Apollo asteroids are thought to have originated in the main asteroid belt, and were ejected into their current orbits by gravitational interactions with Jupiter. </p>
            <h1>Number</h1>
            <p>
                There are currently over 1,600 known Apollo asteroids. 
            </p>
            <h1>Other names</h1>
            <p>
                Apollo asteroids are also known as Venus-crossers and Mars-crossers because their orbits cross those of these planets as well.
