                The Aten asteroids are a dynamical group of asteroids whose orbits bring them into proximity with Earth. By definition, Atens are Earth-crossing asteroids (semi-major axis < 1.0 AU and aphelion > 0.983 AU).
                <br>
                The Aten Asteroids spend most of their time sunward of Earth’s Orbit, crossing out for a third or a quarter of their time. They have been accessible since the first days of humanity’s expansion into space, and so they were some of the first to be mined. The mining of titanium, platinum and nickel-iron had made large fortunes, however the push out into the main belt and the moons of Jupiter and Saturn had left them behind. As mining technologies improved, ore that had been exhausted generations before was rich enough for the new techniques to wring out a little more.
