            <p>Asteroids are rocky bodies that orbit the Sun, primarily found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. They vary in size from small pebbles to objects hundreds of kilometers in diameter.</p>
            <h3>Types of Asteroids</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>C-type (Carbonaceous):</strong> The most common type, rich in carbon.</li>
                <li><strong>S-type (Silicaceous):</strong> Composed of silicate minerals and nickel-iron.</li>
                <li><strong>M-type (Metallic):</strong> Made mostly of metallic iron and nickel.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Composition</h3>
            <p>Asteroids are primarily made up of rock and metal. They lack the icy components found in comets, making them more stable in their orbits.</p>

            <h2>Comets</h2>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Comet_Hale-Bopp_1995O1.jpg" alt="Comet" class="image">
            <p>Comets are icy celestial bodies that, when passing close to the Sun, heat up and release gas and dust. This process creates a glowing coma and often a tail that can be seen from Earth.</p>
            <h3>Types of Comets</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Short-period Comets:</strong> Have orbits that take less than 200 years.</li>
                <li><strong>Long-period Comets:</strong> Have orbits that can take thousands of years.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Composition</h3>
            <p>Comets consist mainly of water ice, frozen gases, dust, and rocky material. Their volatile substances are responsible for the spectacular tails they develop when approaching the Sun.</p>

        <section id="differences" class="differences">
            <h2>Differences Between Asteroids and Comets</h2>
            <p>Asteroids are primarily composed of rock and metal, while comets are icy bodies that release gas and dust. Asteroids typically have more stable orbits compared to the highly elliptical orbits of comets.</p>

        <section id="exploration" class="exploration">
            <h2>Exploration Missions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>NEAR Shoemaker:</strong> The first spacecraft to land on an asteroid (Eros) in 2001.</li>
                <li><strong>Rosetta:</strong> Successfully orbited and landed on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in 2014.</li>
                <li><strong>Dawn:</strong> Studied the two largest bodies in the asteroid belt, Vesta and Ceres.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Famous Examples</h2>
            <h3>Asteroids</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ceres:</strong> The largest object in the asteroid belt and classified as a dwarf planet.</li>
                <li><strong>Vesta:</strong> A large asteroid known for its unique surface features.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Comets</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Halley's Comet:</strong> A well-known comet that is visible from Earth approximately every 76 years.</li>
                <li><strong>Comet Hale-Bopp:</strong> One of the brightest comets visible in the late 1990s.</li>
