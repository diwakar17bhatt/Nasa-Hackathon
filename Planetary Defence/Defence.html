            <h1>Planetary Defence</h1>
            <p>
                Planetary defense against Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) has become an increasingly important focus for space
                agencies and researchers worldwide. NEOs include asteroids and comets that come within 1.3 astronomical
                units of the Earth and pose potential threats due to their size and impact energy. Here are the main
                strategies and technologies currently being developed and employed for planetary defense:
                <br>
            <h2>Detection and Tracking</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>Telescopes and Surveys:</h3>
            
            Ground-based and space-based telescopes, like the Pan-STARRS and NEOWISE missions, are crucial for detecting
            NEOs. They help track their orbits and predict future paths.
            
            Surveys aim to identify as many NEOs as possible, especially those larger than 140 meters, which could cause
            significant damage upon impact.
            </p>
            <h3>Data Sharing:</h3>
            
            <p>
                Collaborative efforts among international space agencies, such as NASA, ESA, and others, enhance the
                detection capabilities and provide a global tracking network.
            </p>
            <h2>Characterization</h2>
            <p>
                Once detected, understanding the physical properties of NEOs is essential:
            </p>
            <h3>Spectroscopy</h3>
            
            <p>
                This technique analyzes the light reflected from NEOs to determine their composition, size, and
                structure.
                Radar Imaging: Radar data can provide detailed information about an object's shape, rotation, and
                surface characteristics, aiding in assessing potential impact risks.
            </p>
            <h2>Impact Mitigation Strategies</h2>
            
            <p>If a potential impact is identified, several strategies are considered:</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Kinetic Impactor:</h3>
            
            <p>

                This method involves sending a spacecraft to collide with the NEO at high speed, altering its
                trajectory. NASAâ€™s Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission successfully demonstrated this
                approach in 2022.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Gravity Tractor:</h3>
            
            <p>A spacecraft could hover near the NEO, using its gravitational pull to gradually alter the object's path
                over time. This method requires precise calculations and long lead times.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Nuclear Detonation:</h3>
            
            <p>As a last resort, a nuclear device could be detonated near the NEO to change its trajectory. This method
                raises concerns about fallout and is still highly theoretical.</p>
