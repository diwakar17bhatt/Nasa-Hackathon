            <br>
            <h3>Discovery</h3>
            <p>Malcolm Hartley discovered Comet 103P/Hartley 2 on March 15, 1986 using the Schmidt Telescope at the Siding Spring Observatory in Australia.</p>
            
            <h3>Size</h3>
            <p>81P/Wild (Wild 2) (Wild is pronounced vilt) is a small comet with the shape of a flattened sphere and measures about 1.03 x 1.24 x 1.71 miles (1.65 x 2 x 2.75 kilometers).</p>
            
            <h3>Distance from Earth</h3>
            <p>The distance of Comet 103P/Hartley from Earth is currently 690,758,776.4 kilometers, equivalent to 4.6174372210 Astronomical Units. Light takes 38m 24.123s to travel from Comet 103P/Hartley and arrive to us.The distance of Comet 81P/Wild 2 from Earth varies, but at its closest point, it's 0.60 AU from Earth's orbit.</p>

            <h3>Velocity of Asteroid</h3>
            <p><u> NASA Stardust spacecraft encountered comet Wild 2 on January 2, 2004 with a relative velocity of 6.1 kilometers per second (km/s):</u>  The Stardust mission was designed to study comet Wild 2 because it was a relatively new Jupiter family comet and had a low encounter velocity. The low velocity allowed the spacecraft to capture comet dust instead of it blowing through the collectors. The spacecraft returned to Earth in 2006 with samples of cometary material trapped in aerogel.</p>

            <h3>Period of Rotation</h3>
            <p>The rotation period of Comet 81P/Wild 2 is 13.5 hours, with an error bar of 0.1 hours. The comet's shortest axis is believed to be its rotational axis because it is the most dynamically stable.</p>

            <h3>Orbital Period</h3>
            <p>The orbital period of Comet 81P/Wild 2, also known as Wild 2, is 6.41 years</p>
