            <h1>Borrelly Comet</h1>
            <br>
            <h3>Discovery</h3>
            <p>
                Comet 19P/Borrelly was discovered by Alphonse Louis Nicolas Borrelly on Dec. 28, 1904, in Marseille, France.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Size</h3>
            <p>
                The nucleus of comet 19P/Borrelly is approximately 5 miles (8 kilometers) long and has dimensions of 8 × 4 × 4 kilometers. This makes it larger than 99% of asteroids, and comparable in size to the San Francisco Bay.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Distance from Earth</h3>
            <p>
                The distance of Comet 19P/Borrelly from Earth is currently 963,399,823.0 kilometers, equivalent to 6.4399300501 Astronomical Units. Light takes 53m 33.556s to travel from Comet 19P/Borrelly and arrive to us.
            </p>

            <h3>Velocity of Asteroid</h3>
            <p>
                The average orbit speed of Comet 19P/Borrelly is 15.70 kilometers per second (km/s). The comet's relative speed when the Deep Space 1 spacecraft flew by it in 2001 was 16.5 km/s.
            </p>

            <h3>Orbital Period</h3>
            <p>
                It takes 3.30 years for Encke to orbit the sun once. Comet Encke has the shortest orbital period of any known comet within our solar system. Encke last reached perihelion (closest approach to the sun) in 2015.
