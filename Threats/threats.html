                Impacts can potentially lead to significant
                damage to life and property on our planet.
                The impacts of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9
                on Jupiter in 1994 led to coordinated
                efforts to discover, track, characterize and
                catalogue NEOs, especially those that
                may pose a hazard to the Earth.
                <br>
                The Chelyabinsk super-bolide on 15 February 2013 serves as an explicit reminder that even relatively
                small asteroids (~20 metres across) can penetrate the atmosphere. In 2022, two previously
                unknown asteroids were observed only hours before they
                entered the Earth’s atmosphere – one over the ocean near
                Iceland, the other over Canada. Both were small enough to disintegrate in the Earth’s atmosphere and not
                result in any damage.
                While these asteroid impacts provided the unique and real-time
                opportunity to test the systems currently in place to track a
                celestial object’s trajectory on a collision course with our planet,
                they also served as a further reminder that a NEO impact from
                an unknown asteroid could occur at any time.
