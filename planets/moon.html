        <h2 style="color: rgb(252, 252, 252);">Facts about -Moon</h2>
        <br>
        <p style="color: rgb(252, 252, 252);">Our Moon shares a name with all moons simply because people didn't know other moons existed until Galileo Galilei discovered four moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610. In Latin, the Moon was called Luna, which is the main adjective for all things Moon-related: lunar.

        </p>
        <br>
        
        <p style="color:rgb(252, 252, 252);">The many missions that have explored the Moon have found no evidence to suggest it has its own living things. However, the Moon could be the site of future colonization by humans. The discovery that the Moon harbors water ice, and that the highest concentrations occur within darkened craters at the poles, makes the Moon a little more hospitable for future human colonists.

        </p>

        <h2 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255)">Size And Distance</h2>
        <p style ="color:rgb(255, 255, 255)">With a radius of about 1,080 miles (1,740 kilometers), the Moon is less than a third of the width of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, the Moon would be about as big as a coffee bean.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p style ="color:rgb(255, 255, 255)">The Moon is an average of 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers) away. That means 30 Earth-sized planets could fit in between Earth and the Moon. </p>
        <br>
        <h2 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255)">Impact On The Earth</h2>
        <p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255)">Tides are caused by the gravitational tug from the Moon and Sun. The biggest tide in the world is in the Bay of Fundy in Canada. The difference between low and high tide there can be as much as 16.3 metres.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255)">Although the lack of eclipses of any kind would be a sad loss, without the Moon’s glare, darker night skies would be great for anyone with a telescope. The full moon is 14,000 times brighter than Venus, the next-brightest object in the sky. No Moon would allow astronomers to enjoy pristine dark skies all year round – only daylight, weather and human-made light pollution hampering the view of space.</p>
