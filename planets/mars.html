        <h2 style="color: rgb(252, 252, 252);">Facts about -Mars</h2>
        <br>
        <p style="color: rgb(252, 252, 252);">Mars is the fourth planet from the sun and has a distinct rusty red appearance and two unusual moons. 



        </p>
        <br>
        
        <p style="color:rgb(252, 252, 252);">The Red Planet is a cold, desert world within our solar system. It has a very thin atmosphere, but the dusty, lifeless (as far as we know it) planet is far from dull. 

        </p>

        <h2 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255)">Size And Distance</h2>
        <p style ="color:rgb(255, 255, 255)">With a radius of 2,106 miles (3,390 kilometers), Mars is about half the size of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mars would be about as big as a raspberry. From an average distance of 142 million miles (228 million kilometers), Mars is 1.5 astronomical units away from the Sun.

        <h2 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255)">Impact On The Earth</h2>
        <p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255)">Every 2.4 million years, Mars's orbit comes close enough to Earth that its gravity can affect it, tilting Earth's usual path and orientation. This orbital shift causes Earth to be exposed to more sunlight, warming the climate, which, in turn, stirs up ocean currents and makes them stronger.</p>
