        <h2 style="color: rgb(252, 252, 252);">Facts about -Jupiter</h2>
        <br>
        <p style="color: rgb(252, 252, 252);">Approximately -110°C at an atmospheric pressure of 1 bar (an arbitrarily defined ‘surface’ for Jupiter where surface pressure matches that of sea level on Earth – this is 125 degrees colder than Earth’s mean sea level temperature).
        </p>
        <br>
        
        <p style="color:rgb(252, 252, 252);">Jupiter has the largest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, composed of mostly hydrogen (approx. 90%) and helium (10%), with minor amounts of methane, ammonia, and other trace gases and aerosols.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255)">Size And Distance</h2>
        <p style ="color:rgb(255, 255, 255)">With a radius of 43,440.7 miles (69,911 kilometers), Jupiter is 11 times wider than Earth. If Earth were the size of a grape, Jupiter would be about as big as a basketball.
        </p>
       <br>
        <p style ="color:rgb(255, 255, 255)">From an average distance of 484 million miles (778 million kilometers), Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 43 minutes to travel from the Sun to Jupiter. </p>
