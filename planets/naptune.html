        <p style="color: rgb(252, 252, 252);">Dark, cold, and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is more than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth. Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible to the naked eye. In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846.

        <p style="color:rgb(252, 252, 252);">Neptune is so far from the Sun that high noon on the big blue planet would seem like dim twilight to us. The warm light we see here on our home planet is roughly 900 times as bright as sunlight on Neptune.

        </p>

        <h2 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255)">Size And Distance</h2>
        <p style ="color:rgb(255, 255, 255)">Neptune is slightly smaller than Uranus and has a diameter of 31,000 miles (50,000 kilometers), so about 4 Earths would fit across its face.
        </p>
       <br>
        <p style ="color:rgb(255, 255, 255)"> Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun. It orbits at an average distance of 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion km), thirty times farther than Earth.Orbit around the Sun: It takes 165 Earth years for Neptune to go around the Sun one time. </p>
