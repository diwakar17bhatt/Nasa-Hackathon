            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Near Earth Objects (NEOs) are celestial bodies such as asteroids and comets that come within 1.3 astronomical units of Earth. They hold immense potential as resources for future space missions and even for Earth’s economy.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="types">
            <h2>Types of NEOs</h2>
            <p>NEOs are categorized mainly into two types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Asteroids:</strong> Rocky bodies that orbit the Sun, mainly found in the asteroid belt. They are rich in mineral raw materials required to build structures in space.</li>
                <li><strong>Comets:</strong> Icy bodies that release gas or dust and are known for their spectacular tails. They contain valuable water and carbon-based molecules necessary to sustain life.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="resources">
            <h2>Potential Resources</h2>
            <p>NEOs can provide various resources, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Water:</strong> Comets are rich in water ice, which can provide copious quantities of liquid hydrogen and oxygen, the two primary ingredients in rocket fuel.</li>
                <li><strong>Metals:</strong> Asteroids contain valuable metals like platinum, gold, and rare earth elements that can be mined and used in developing space structures.</li>
                <li><strong>Building Materials:</strong> Regolith from asteroids can be used for constructing habitats on other celestial bodies.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While it is not presently cost-effective to mine these minerals and bring them back to Earth, they can be utilized in developing the necessary infrastructure for exploring and colonizing our solar system in the twenty-first century.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="benefits">
            <h2>Benefits of NEO Utilization</h2>
            <p>Utilizing NEOs offers several advantages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Resource Availability:</strong> Reduces the strain on Earth’s resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Support for Space Exploration:</strong> Provides essential supplies for missions to Mars and beyond.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Growth:</strong> Potentially leads to new industries and job creation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Comets could serve as the watering holes and gas stations for interplanetary spacecraft, facilitating long-term exploration and colonization efforts.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="challenges">
            <h2>Challenges Ahead</h2>
            <p>Despite the potential, several challenges must be addressed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cost of Exploration:</strong> Launching missions to NEOs can be expensive.</li>
                <li><strong>Technological Limitations:</strong> Current technology may not be sufficient for efficient resource extraction.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal and Ethical Issues:</strong> Questions about ownership and the impact on space ecosystems need to be resolved.</li>
                <li><strong>Risk of Impact:</strong> The same NEOs that are resources can pose risks if they enter a collision course with Earth.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="technologies">
            <h2>Technologies for Mining NEOs</h2>
            <p>To efficiently extract resources from NEOs, several advanced technologies are being developed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Robotic Mining:</strong> Autonomous robots equipped with drills and sensors could be sent to asteroids to extract minerals.</li>
                <li><strong>In-situ Resource Utilization (ISRU):</strong> Techniques to use materials found on NEOs directly, reducing the need to transport resources from Earth.</li>
                <li><strong>Spacecraft Propulsion Innovations:</strong> Advances in propulsion systems, such as ion drives, could make it easier to reach and mine these bodies.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="future">
            <h2>The Future of NEO Exploration</h2>
            <p>The next century could see significant advancements in our ability to explore and utilize NEOs. Collaborative international missions could pave the way for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Permanent Bases:</strong> Establishing outposts on NEOs for research and resource extraction.</li>
                <li><strong>Interplanetary Trade:</strong> Developing a market for resources mined from NEOs, impacting global economies.</li>
                <li><strong>Colonization Efforts:</strong> Using resources from NEOs to support missions to Mars and beyond.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>As we look to the future, the exploration and utilization of NEOs could play a vital role in human expansion into space, paving the way for sustainable resource management beyond Earth.</p>
