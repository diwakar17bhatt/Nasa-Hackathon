                As the consequences of environmental degradation and natural resource depletion become increasingly severe, scientists are placing a greater emphasis on not only sustainably utilizing the resources that we already have, but also on identifying new methods of obtaining resources. For example, scientists are pursuing novel but contentious resource extraction techniques such as fracking. One particular suggested solution, asteroid mining, is literally out of this world.Although proposed many times, the first tangible effort to enable the exploration and development of asteroid mining came in 2012 from Planetary Resources, a Seattle-based aerospace company. Planetary Resources were then closely followed by a similar company, Deep Space Industries. Both groups have made significant contributions to the field, designing satellites that have identified about 15,000 asteroids with significant potential for mining.

                Opportunities in Asteroid Mining Generally, asteroid mining remains hypothetical, mostly because of its exorbitant cost. While specific estimates of the cost of commercial mining remain unclear, similarities can be drawn between such programs and NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission, which seeks to obtain samples from a near-earth asteroid named Bennu. Despite only being projected to return between 400 grams and 1 kilogram of material, the mission is projected to take 7 years and cost over US$1 billion. Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries were unable to finance themselves to meet such high development costs. Both companies were acquired by other businesses in 2018 and 2019, respectively.

                Despite the high price tag, the development of asteroid mining technology may very well be a worthwhile endeavor due to the extremely valuable resources that asteroids have to offer. For example, Asterank, which measures the potential value of over 6,000 asteroids that NASA currently tracks, has determined that mining just the top 10 most cost-effective asteroids–that is, those that are both closest to Earth and greatest in value–would produce a profit of around US$1.5 trillion. There is also great potential for further expansion. One asteroid, 16 Psyche, has been reported to contain US$700 quintillion worth of gold, enough for every person on earth to receive about US$93 billion.
