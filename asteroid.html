        <p style="color: rgb(244, 244, 250);">Most asteroids can be found orbiting our Sun between Mars and Jupiter within the main asteroid belt. Asteroids range in size from Vesta – the largest asteroid at about 329 miles (530 kilometers) in diameter – to bodies that are less than 33 feet (10 meters) across. The total mass of all the asteroids combined is less than that of Earth's Moon.

            Sometimes, asteroids and comets are nudged into Earth's neighborhood by the gravity of nearby planets. These objects are called Near-Earth Objects, or NEOs. There are more than 35,000 NEOs, according to the Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). About 99% of NEOs are asteroids. Their closest approach to the Sun is less than 1.3 times Earth's distance from the Sun.</p>
        <h2 style="color: rgb(236, 243, 236);">Main Asteroid Belt</h2>
        <p style="color: rgb(247, 235, 235);">Main Asteroid Belt: The majority of known asteroids orbit within the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, generally with not very elongated orbits. The belt is estimated to contain between 1.1 and 1.9 million asteroids larger than 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) in diameter, and millions of smaller ones. Early in the history of the solar system, the gravity of newly formed Jupiter brought an end to the formation of planetary bodies in this region and caused the small bodies to collide with one another, fragmenting them into the asteroids we observe today.</p>
   <h2 style="color: beige;">Near-Earth Asteroid</h2>
<p style="color: beige;">Near-Earth Asteroids: These objects have orbits that pass close by that of Earth. Asteroids that actually cross Earth's orbital path are known as Earth-crossers.</p>
