        <p style="color: beige;">Trojans: These asteroids share an orbit with a larger planet, but do not collide with it because they gather around two special places in the orbit (called the L4 and L5 Lagrangian points). There, the gravitational pull from the Sun and the planet are balanced by a trojan's tendency to otherwise fly out of orbit. The Jupiter trojans form the most significant population of trojan asteroids. It is thought that they are as numerous as the asteroids in the asteroid belt. There are Mars and Neptune trojans, and NASA announced the discovery of an Earth trojan in 2011.Some of these leftover space rocks are pristine asteroids that now orbit with Jupiter in two huge swarms leading and trailing the planet. They’re known as the Trojan asteroids. They’re really mysterious and we think that they come from the outer solar system. They’re also special in terms of understanding the evolution of the solar system because they’ve remained gravitationally stable for over billions of years. Astronomers have only been able to study these distant and enigmatic small bodies from Earth, but all of that is about to change.

            NASA’s Lucy mission will soon embark on a 12-year journey to visit these primitive asteroids. This will be the first time that we are able to see these objects up close!
            
            So, what are the Trojan asteroids? They’re asteroids that orbit with Jupiter around the Sun that ultimately hold the clues to the formation of our solar system.</p>
