            <h3>Discovery</h3>
            <p>Eros was discovered on Aug. 13, 1898, by Gustav Witt, director of the Urania Observatory in Berlin, and independently observed on the same date by Auguste H.P. Charlois in Nice, France. In a break with tradition at the time, the asteroid was given a male name: Eros, the Greek god of love and son of Mercury and Venus.</p>
            
            <h3>Size</h3>
            <p>Asteroid 433 Eros is approximately 33 by 13 by 13 kilometers (20.5 by 8 by 8 miles) in size, making it one of the larger near-Earth asteroids. It's also one of the most elongated asteroids, with a potato-like shape.</p>
            
            <h3>Distace from Earth</h3>
            <p>The distance of Asteroid 433 Eros from Earth is currently 350,800,091 kilometers, equivalent to 2.344954 Astronomical Units.</p>
