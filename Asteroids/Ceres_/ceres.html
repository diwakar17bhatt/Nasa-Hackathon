            <h1>Ceres Asteroid</h1>
            <br>
            <h3>Discovery</h3>
            <p>Dwarf planet Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and it's the only dwarf planet located in the inner solar system. It was the first member of the asteroid belt to be discovered when Giuseppe Piazzi spotted it in 1801. When NASA's Dawn arrived in 2015, Ceres became the first dwarf planet to be explored by a spacecraft.</p>
            
            <h3>Size</h3>
            <p>With a radius of 296 miles (476 kilometers), Ceres is 1/13 the radius of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Ceres would be about as big as a poppy seed. From an average distance of 257 million miles (413 million kilometers), Ceres is 2.8 astronomical units away from the Sun.</p>
            
            <h3>Distance from Earth</h3>
            <p>The distance of Asteroid 1 Ceres from Earth is currently 417,721,987 kilometers, equivalent to 2.792299 Astronomical Units. Light takes 23 minutes and 13.3706 seconds to travel from Asteroid 1 Ceres and arrive to us.</p>

            <h3>Velocity of Asteroid</h3>
            <p>Surface speed: The surface speed at the equator of Ceres is around 327.7 kilometers per hour. 
                <br>
                Escape velocity: The escape velocity from the surface of Ceres is around 508.2.
                <br> 
                Equatorial rotation velocity: The equatorial rotation velocity of Ceres is 92.61 meters per second. 
                <br>
                Sidereal rotation period: The sidereal rotation period of Ceres is 9.074170 hours. </p>

            <h3>Period of Rotation</h3>
            <p>The dwarf planet Ceres rotates on its axis once every 9.07 hours, making it one of the shortest days in the solar system.</p>

            <h3>Orbital Period</h3>
            <p>Ceres takes 1,682 Earth days, or 4.6 Earth years, to make one trip around the Sun.</p>
