            <h1>Apophis Asteroid</h1>
            <br>
            <h3>Discovery</h3>
            <p>Discovered on June 19,2004 at the <b>Kitt Peak National</b> observatory in Arizona, Apophis was identified as one of the most hazardous asteroids that could impact Earth. But that impact assessment changed after astronomers tracked Apophis, and its orbit became better determined.</p>
            
            <h3>Size</h3>
            <p>The asteroid Apophis is estimated to be around 1,100 feet (340 meters) wide, and its longest axis measures about 1,500 feet (450 meters). This is roughly the size of five football fields and taller than the Empire State Building.</p>
            
            <h3>Distace from Earth</h3>
            <p>The distance of Asteroid Apophis from Earth is currently 307,029,967 kilometers, equivalent to 2.052369 Astronomical Units. Light takes 17 minutes and 4.1417 seconds to travel from Asteroid 99942 Apophis and arrive to us.</p>

            <h3>Velocity of Asteroid</h3>
            <p>The average speed of the asteroid Apophis as it orbits the sun is 30.98 kilometers per second (km/s)</p>

            <h3>Period of Rotation</h3>
            <p>The asteroid Apophis rotates on its short axis once every about 30 hours. It also has a rocking motion back and forth on its long axis, which takes longer than the short axis wobble. This rocking motion is called "non-principal axis rotation</p>

            <h3>Orbital Period</h3>
            <p>Apophis orbits the sun every 324 days (0.89 years), coming as close as 0.75 AU and reaching as far as 1.10 AU from the sun.</p>
